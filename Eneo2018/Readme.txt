Me: Hi, I need to add some custom JS to my form. Do you have some sample JS files?
Gabriela: 
Hello 
I'm afraid not, as we don't offer coding support. We only offer the means of implementing the JS to the form. 
Me: Not even a sample JS file that I can see?
Gabriela: Here is an example of JS that might be of help: 123formbuilder.com/blog/2017/0... and 123formbuilder.com/blog/2017/0... 
These are some examples, however, they are very specific and they were developed for the old version of the editor.
